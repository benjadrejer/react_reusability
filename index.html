    <h1>Reusability Guide for React / Frontend Development</h1>
    <p class="reusability-guide__intro">
      Considerations & musings on how to increase reusability on a primarily React-based frontend environment.
      Most of these points could also be applied to other frontend frameworks or vanilla JS.
      Also includes optimizations on CSS and more team & developer-oriented points.
      Some of the points might not be directly related to reusability, but are nevertheless good to remember when
      creating reusable components & code.
      Several of the points presented here are certainly very hard to implement and follow properly, but being aware of
      them is the first step to succeed, and it is without a doubt a process.
      I hope this will turn out to be useful, and I hope to be able to improve & expand this guide in the future!

      <h3>Team/Developer Considerations</h3>
      <h5 id="shared-space">Shared Space</h5>
      <p>
        It perhaps goes without saying, but in a company structure with several or dozens of developers working together,
        if the goal is to collaborate on code - and and by extension, re-use components -, having a shared space to work & interact is a big help.
        This could either be a single repository with all the company code, or at the very least a shared repository for components.<br>
        The second option is a bit more cumbersome in that such components would need to be copied to the other actual site repositories,
        so a kind of component versioning would be needed.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="storybook">Storybook</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook">Storybook Github</a>
        Storybook provides a canvas outside of the actual application, in which components can be built and shown off to any interested parties.<br>
        It being isolated, it helps the developer to develop components that do not depend on any outside sources for functionality or style.<br>
        As components should generally not be built with specific sizes in mind (more on that later), it's very common to wrap the components
        shown inside storybook in wrapper elements (also more on that) giving a specific width / positioning purely to have it display nicely in storybook.<br>
        Storybook has a lot of addons, but by fair the most useful & recommended are the Knobs & Viewport addons, enabling 'mock-props' to be dynamically passed
        to the component inside storybook, as well as providing responsive views.<br>
        Storybook is highly recommended for any React-team that wants to focus strongly on reusability of components and shared libraries.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="more-not-less">Duplicates is fine</h5>
      <p>
        Generally, if you have several teams working separately, ideally proper communication would flow between the teams.<br>
        But this is not always the case, and if 2 teams both end up with a reusable component that is made to solve the same issue,
        it might not be a bad thing! They can be compared and refactored, and the end result might very well be an even cleaner component.<br>
        It's certainly better that both teams attempt the reusable route, instead of just cobbling something together quickly, and ending up
        with 2 components that solve the same issue but cannot be ported.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="awareness">Awareness</h5>
      <p>
        This point is simply one of communication. Many developers can have a tendency to sit in their own bubble and code away.<br>
        While this is certainly productive, it might not be the best practice in a team, or particularly in a multi-team environment.<br>
        Other members should be made aware of what is being worked on. This is often done through daily syncs/standups and/or task management systems,
        but there is also a lot of value in just talking and communication in-person or through apps like slack, regularly.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>React & Typing</h3>
      <h5 id="hooks">Hooks</h5>
      <p>
        React Hooks are a relatively new thing, but quite popular and highly recommended to use. They have proved to be slightly more efficient
        than class-based components in terms of size & rendering speed, but the main arguments for using hooks would be be the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Components don't need all the scaffolding of a class-based component, they can be much smaller and efficient</li>
          <li>You have the possibility to extract pieces of state into reusable custom hooks</li>
          <li>You have most of the component lifecycle methods in a single hook - useEffect</li>
        </ul>
        Hooks also help to make the developer very conscious of any state to be added. If useState calls get to 3+, it's a strong sign
        that there is probably some logic that can be made into a separate component or custom hook. We want components to be as small
        and mobile as possible.<br>
        As 'root' components in an application (assuming no Redux), class-based components can still have some merit simply due to the
        amount of state they might need to keep track of.
      </p>
      <h5 id="custom-hooks">Custom Hooks</h5>
      <p>
        While creating new components is useful for avoiding duplicate JSX, Custom Hooks help avoiding duplicate logic.<br>
        Certainly, defining where a Custom Hook makes sense is not the easiest thing in the world, but there is a few pointers that
        can be used:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data Fetching is usually a prime-candidate for a Custom Hook
            1 Custom Hook can perhaps even take care of all the data-fetching needs for a while site/application.<br>
            Certainly, not all data fits out of the box, so having some intermediary functions to transform that data
            into what the component needs might be necessary - but all the requesting & fetching can be done in the hook.
          </li>
          <li>
            To determine whether something makes sense as a Custom Hook, look at all the logic located above the JSX in a component and
            try to identify which logic is tightly related. This is usually some state as well as some useEffect (lifecycle) logic.
            If this can be decoupled from the rest of the logic (which would in any case be preferable), it can be a Custom Hook.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5 id="memo">React.memo</h5>
      <p>
        React components re-render every time state & props change - even if the new value is in fact identical to the old.<br>
        As such, it's good practice to wrap every component that accepts props in React.memo, which will memoize the prop values
        and only cause a re-render when the new prop values are different from the old.<br>
        React.memo does not memoize state (as opposed to the class-based PureComponent), but it is extraordinarily rare to cause
        state updates with no actual changes, so I would not consider this a great loss.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="typing">Typing</h5>
      <p>
        React has generally 2 options for providing typing help for the developers, which I believe helps built reusable.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>
            Typescript helps components conform to certain interfaces, and type-checks any props and state.
            It has a much higher learning curve than PropTypes, but the potential benefit is also much greater.
            Typescript also enables the use of enums, generics, tuples, interfaces, which are not usually features of JS.
            It perhaps makes development more time intensive, but in the end I believe it makes for better Javascript developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prop-types">PropTypes</a>
            PropTypes is a simple solution that provides type-checking for props passed into components.
            The developer describes what types the props provided are supposed to conform to, and other developers making
            use of said component will have an easier time telling what it expects and by extension what it does.
            That's really all it does - it's a much simpler option than Typescript. But if Typescript is used, PropTypes
            will be completely obsolete.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5 id="redux">Redux</h5>
      <p>
        Redux is a very useful library for big applications to keep some shared global state. However, whenever a component is connected to Redux,
        it absolutely kills any Reusability. A connected component is tightly coupled with the particular Redux store that it expects prop from,
        as well as any action creators it tries to make use of.<br>
        As such, Redux should only be connected to components that are not intended to be reusable - which is usually the root component of an app.
        Reusable components should be passed any data they need as regular props, from the root.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Component Structure</h3>
      <h5 id="prefer-small">Prefer Small Components</h5>
      <p>
        When developing, it is super easy to get carried away and get great idea after great idea - which will promptly get implemented.
        While this is not necessarily a bad thing on its own, it can very easily lead to big, monolithic components that either cannot be moved,
        or requires an equal amount of time to refactor into a more mobile version.<br>
        With this in mind, it should be a goal to keep components small, with only a few (if any) pieces of state to keep track of.
        In React, composition is king, so having small composable components that can be 'plugged in' to solve more complicated tasks,
        should be the goal whenever an app/component is being worked on.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="prefer-generic">Make Generic Components</h5>
      <p>
        By Generic, what is meant is particularly in regards to naming.<br>
        As we all know, naming variables in a semantic way can be hard, and certainly, doing it in a semantic & generic way is even harder.
        But the goal should always be to provide generic variable & function names in reusable components. <br>
        A "RangeSlider" component should not have any references to "price", even though that is most likely what it will be used for in most cases.
        As soon as a "price" is mentioned inside the component, it loses semantic reusability, although it might still 'work fine'.<br>
        Developers of the future will thank you for generic naming when they need to leverage the component for some other task.<br>
        This could potentially be taken even further by having some naming-conventions for often-used props. Such as 'value', 'onSomeEventChange',
        'callback', 'label', etc.<br>
        By example, a Dropdown component could take a 'value', a 'label' and an 'onValueChange' function.<br>
        A Checkbox could take the same, 'value', 'label', 'onValueChange'.<br>
        Developers would then be able to logically tell what props to pass into most components.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="typography-components">Typography Components</h5>
      <p>
        Typography components is the idea of having very simple 'wrapper' components that only apply some style around the children passed into it.
        Obvious use-cases would be for grid of items, the Grid typographic components holding the styling to line a list of items up in a grid.
        Or a Box component that provides some very specific width & height styling for the component being wrapped.<br>
        By extension, a reusable components root container should not declare any of the following styles:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>margin</li>
          <li>width</li>
          <li>position</li>
          <li>top</li>
          <li>left</li>
          <li>right</li>
          <li>bottom</li>
          <li>transform</li>
          <li>display</li>
        </ul>
        As doing so pretty much destroys reusability - the component can no longer be 'put anywhere', but only 'put where the styling fits'.<br>
        Instead they can be wrapped by a typographic component that decides what size & position the component should have in the given context.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>CSS & Styling</h3>
      <h5 id="global-styles">Global Styles</h5>
      <p>
        Global styling is not a bad thing at all on static websites that are never meant to change. However, on a dynamic site that keeps
        evolving, renewing and implementing new features, it can be an absolute disaster. There is nothing worse than fighting some
        global styling when building a component, trying to beat the global stylings specificity or even adding !important.<br>
        As such, global styling should be kept to the bare minimum:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser normalizing (removing default body margin etc.)</li>
          <li>Box sizing</li>
          <li>Fonts</li>
        </ul>
        Anything else will most likely end up conflicting with something, at some point, and it can also end up being quite a quest
        for a developer to attempt to clean up or refactor a bunch of global styling that could be potentially be used anywhere on the whole site.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="styleguide">Styleguide</h5>
      <p>
        While a 'regular' styleguide is mostly unnecessary when working with reusable components, it still holds value particularly for
        colors and perhaps font-sizing, laying out some css variables denoting which colors are used throughout the site (the 'brand coloring'),
        and which font-sizes (preferably in em) are to be used for common texts (titles, subtitles, bodytext, labels, errors, notes, etc.).<br>
        So by a stylguide, what is meant here is actually a _variables.scss sheet containing valid colors & font-sizes to be used on the site.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="wrappers">Wrappers</h5>
      <p>
        This is very related to Typography Components mentioned previously, so this is mostly to re-iterate:<br>
        Do not declare contextual styling on root elements in components, instead make use of a Typography components or,
        if it doesn't make sense to have a reusable typography component for this particular case, just make a wrapper element
        with the positioning styling you will need in this particular case.<br>
        As such, wrappers are essentially one-off Typography components.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="scoping">SCSS Scoping</h5>
      <p>
        If using regular scss (or less) - and not CSS Modules or Styled Components - manual scoping is extremely important.<br>
        Any component-level scss should be nested inside a root selector (which should be as unique as possible), to avoid
        styling interfering with other parts of the site/other components. This rule should not be broken.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="mixins">Mixins</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">Mixins</a> are to css what Reusable Components are to React.<br>
        They allow us to write a set of rules intended for specific use-cases - like a button, a list, an input element, etc.
        You can even provide arguments to allow for a degree of customization to a given mixin, such a setting a color.<br>
        Mixins need a bit of love to go with CSS Modules, though. But as luck would have it, there is a webpack loader for that!:<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader">SASS Resources Loader</a><br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="modules">CSS Modules & Styled Components</h5>
      <p>
        There (at least) 2 good options for writing CSS for Reusable React Components, which removes the scoping-issues of
        regular scss/less:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS Modules</a>
            CSS Modules are a way to provide guaranteed component-level scoping and makes
            classes available as variables inside the component. This allows for nicer syntax
            when having conditional classes (particularly in combination with the classNames package).
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled Components</a>
            Styled Components moves styling completely into JS, removing the need for stylesheets,
            using tagged templates <div>(fancy <span class="code-block">func`cool template ${literal}`</span> syntax)</div>
            The idea is quite intriguing!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5 id="classnames">classNames Package</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames">classNames</a> is a small npm package
        that allows for easily dynamically composing classNames of an element, rather than
        the horrible template string interpolation or slightly less-horrible array.join(' ') solutions.<br>
        There are some very interesting synergies with this and CSS Modules, allowing you to do a single
        classNames composition on the root element of a component, including all modifier classes.
        Then in the CSS module, save the root element to global variable and access inside the child
        element classes, adding any modifiers:
        <div class="code-block">
          render() {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;const { className } = this.props;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;const rootClass = classnames({<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[styles.mycomponent]: true,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[styles.mycomponentBig]: ifBig, // Make modifier more general<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;}, className)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return (<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div className={rootClass}&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h2 className={styles.headline}>Headline&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;)<br>
          }<br>
        </div>
        <div class="code-block">
          .mycomponent {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;// root styling<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&Big {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$big: & !global; // Save selector (.mycomponentBig) in variable<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          .headline {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 14px;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;#{$big} & {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Use variable to create selector (.mycomponentBig .headline)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 20px;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
          }<br>
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3 id="common-components">Common Reusable Components</h3>
      <p>
        The following is a list of ideas of reusable components that will find a place on just about any
        ecommerce (or similar) website. It includes proposals for props & state and compositional nature,
        although it certainly might need some additions for the particular company requirements.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="loader">Loader</h5>
      <p>
        Loaders are an integral part of any website making use of ajax (or even just async) requests/JS.<br>
        A reusable loader is quite simple to do - avoid positioning styling and pass in customizable options as props.<br>
        Props: color, classNames<br>
        Optional className-based styling: on-button, on-container, on-input, full-screen. These could instead be created as
        Typography components that would style any children (not just a loader) in relation to being on a button, in a container, etc.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="dropdown">Dropdown</h5>
      <p>
        The HTML select & option elements are not very open to styling, and as such, it's often required to re-implement a select-functionality
        from scratch. When doing so, it's a prime opportunity to allow for more options than a select usually allows, like having pictures in each option
        (for example, a list of emojis, a list of avatars).<br>
        Props: options, selected, onSelectionChange<br>
        Children or options?: There is a few different ways to pass in the list of option elements to the dropdown - either as children, as a list of objects,
        a list of components or a list of functions. For most cases a list of objects will suffice, but for further reusability, it might make sense to pass
        in a list of option components, instead. This would make it easy to switch out one type of option components for another on a case-by-case basis.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="accordion">Accordion</h5>
      <p>
        An accordion usually simply displays information in an accordion-fashion. As such, it won't need to communicate any state to parents, and only
        needs a bit of state to be functional. The accordion options are very similar to what was discussed in the Dropdown (above).<br>
        State: activeIndex<br>
        Props: options<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="search">Search</h5>
      <p>
        A search usually contains a fair amount of logic, especially if it includes a preview of search results (which could, and perhaps should, be a
        separate component). It also contains a text input element that should also be a separate reusable component.<br>
        Search itself is then a composition of the text input, the result preview (list) and the actual search logic - which is a prime candidate for a custom hook.<br>
        The end results shold be a search component that is actually quite lean, has individually reusable components and can itself be placed anywhere.<br>
        The search could potentially accept a callback to send any results to the parent for processing.<br>
        Also worth considering if it should accept an optional submit button.<br>
        State: searchTerm, results<br>
        Props: endpoint, callback?, button?<br>
        Notes: as with any typing-based request functionality, searching should be throttled to avoid request-overload.<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="collapsible">Collapsible</h5>
      <p>
        A Collapsible component accepts children (either as actual children or a custom prop) and hides/shows them when interacted with.<br>
        It should certainly take a component to hide/show, but perhaps also one for customization the look of 'head' of the Collapsible - 
        the part that is shown always, but when the child is hidden & shown.<br>
        By having this Head-component, the Collapsible actually doesn't have any visible html on it's own - 
        it's just a wrapper with a piece of state for hiding/showing the contents.<br>
        State: showing<br>
        Props: Content/children, Head<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="range-slider">Range Slider</h5>
      <p>
        I am not proposing to create a RangeSlider from scratch - that's a lot of work. But having a reusable wrapper component for a RangeSlider package,
        such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc-slider">rc-slider</a>, is quite valuable.<br>
        The wrapper keeps track of the current value(s) chosen, and passes any customizations down through props.<br>
        It's very important to avoid the pitfall of thinking "price" when building a slider like this - as admittedly, for ecommerce, sliders like this
        are more often than not used as price sliders. But it should be usable for any purpose involving filtering based on numbers.<br>
        State: values<br>
        Props: callback, any changeable slider-implementation specific props<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="card">Box / Card</h5>
      <p>
        This is a sort of generic name for a component. The main idea is that any ecommerce company needs a "Product", "Listing", or any component variation thereof.<br>
        These Box components might be composed of several child components, each responsible for a particular part (showing prices, showing descriptions, etc.), such
        that it will be easy to provide / remove functionality down the road, but keep the component itself sturdy.<br>
        These components should have no trouble being placed in grids, sliders, lists, or any other variation of product display thinkable.<br>
        Exactly what functionality & props are required will be very company-dependent.<br>
        State: ideally none<br>
        Props: product, ???<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="checkbox">Checkbox</h5>
      <p>
        Similarly to the Dropdown discussed earlier, html checkboxes are not very styling-friendly, so it's often necessary to create a company-compliant checkbox
        from scratch. Functionality-wise, a checkbox is quite simple, as it should just communicate the checked state to the parent for further processing.<br>
        State: checked<br>
        Props: callback, label<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="carousel">Carousel</h5>
      <p>
        Carousels/Sliders are quite common on ecommerce websites, as it's a concise way of potentially showing a lot of products - although it's arguable how many people
        actually bother sliding trough them.<br>
        Nevertheless, having a Carousel component (wrapping some 3rd party package, such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slick">React Slick</a>) can be a useful thing. This component should be as lean as possible, preferably with only sliding-relevant logic.<br>
        Any additional logic should be kept in the children rendered by the Carousels (such as the Box component described above).<br>
        State: Any 3rd party package-required state<br>
        Props: children<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="image">Image</h5>
      <p>
        It might initially seem like overkill to have a component for an image, but actually, images require a fair amount of considerations.<br>
        Such as, what is the pre-load content? A loader? A low-res version of the actual image? And what should happen when the image is loaded?
        How many different versions of the same image is required (for responsive design)? And what about lazy-loading? Is it square or round?
        An Image component should provide an answer for all these questions.<br>
        Props: image, any changeable options<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="avatar">Avatar</h5>
      <p>
        An Avatar component is especially useful is customers have a login, but even if not, it can be used for employees doing blog posts or similar.<br>
        It should probably make use of the Image component discussed above, and then take some additional information pertaining to the represented individual.<br>
        As such, it's a quite simple component without any state of it's own.<br>
        Props: image, info<br>
      </p>
      <h5 id="chart">Chart</h5>
      <p>
        Reusable Chart components are perhaps not the most immediately useful - but if the company intends to show progress over time in some area, like price fluctuations,
        having a wrapper around a 3rd party library like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts">Recharts</a> is very useful.<br>
        It could be necessary to have a component for each variation of Chart, to avoid having a giant Chart component, but the parent Chart component
        could simply lazily load the requested chart using React.lazy with Suspense, to avoid having all Chart component loaded in every case.<br>
        State: if any, should be defined in the individual Chart components<br>
        Props: chart, any props to customize charts<br>
